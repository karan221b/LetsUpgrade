Question 1: What is your understanding of Blockchain?

A:Blockchain is a decentralized distributed database and cryptography technology that keeps a permanent record of all transactions in a secure, transparent and immutable way. 
Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.

Question 2:What is the core problem Blockchain trying to solve?

Authenticity
Security
Need of powerful third party for trust


Question 3:What are the few features which Blockchain will give you?

Decentralized Network
Immutable
Tamper proof
Verifiable
Data Transparency
High-level security


Question 4:What all things does a Block contain?

Block number
Mining key
Data Records (Data of that block)
Previous block Finger Print


Question 5:How is the verifiability of Blockchain has been attained?

The same copy of data is stored and distributed across many devices.
All other blocks of the same network will detect changes to the data if the data is changed in one place. 
So, the verifiability of the blockchain is achieved.
